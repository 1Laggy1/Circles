This is my second unity game from 2023.

Multiplayer on one device game with garbage very basic c# code and unity knowledge.

This is a project I created back in 2023, before I properly understood object-oriented programming.
Under no circumstances should you look at the code if you value your eyesight.
Please don’t judge me too harshly — I’ve come a long way since then.
